			<p class="text"><span id="title">behind the goggles.</span> is a site run by Sam Anzai, located in Alhambra, California. A competitive swimmer herself, Sam thought it would be interesting to have a site where information about swimmers was compiled in a way that could be easily accessed. Taking web design for her junior year allowed her to create the site. She hopes that visitors will find out something new about swimmers. </p>
