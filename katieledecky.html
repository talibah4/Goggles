			<p class="text" id="kledeckybio">Ledecky was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Mary Gen (Hagan) and David Ledecky. Her paternal grandfather, Jaromír Ledecký, was Czech, and came to the United States from Czechoslovakia in 1947, while her paternal grandmother is Jewish. Her mother is of Irish descent. Ledecky is Catholic.

Ledecky began swimming at the age of six, due to the influence of her older brother, Michael. Her mother swam for the University of New Mexico. Ledecky resides in Bethesda, Maryland, where she attended Little Flower School and then graduated from Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart in 2015. During her high school swimming career, Ledecky twice set the American and US Open record in the 500-yard freestyle and twice set the national, high-school record in the 200-yard freestyle. Ledecky finished her high-school career as the holder of the Stone Ridge school record in every swimming event except the 100-meter breaststroke.

During the summer of 2012, she trained with the Nation's Capital Swim Club (formerly the Curl Burke Swim Club) under coach Yuri Suguiyama. She continues to train with the Nation's Capital Swim Club under coach Bruce Gemmell. During the summers prior to 2012, she swam for Palisades Swim Team in Cabin John, Maryland. Ledecky accepted an athletic scholarship to Stanford University, where she will swim for coach Greg Meehan's Stanford Cardinal women's swimming team beginning in fall 2016.
